FreeRTOS Application in a Real-Time Air Quality Monitoring Architecture for Smart Campus
This project employs FreeRTOS, a Real-Time Operating System (RTOS), in an air quality monitoring 
architecture within a Smart Campus scenario. The RTOS-based EndNode was compared to a non-RTOS EndNode. 
The following metrics were analyzed: Throughput, Transmission and Reception Time, and Time Gain.
